## DAY 1 — Launch Alert / Curiosity Builder

**Subject Line:** This AI turns text into whiteboard videos (just launched)

**Preview Text:** No design skills. No freelancers. Just type and click.

**Body:**

Hey {{FIRST_NAME}},

Quick question — when's the last time you actually *finished* making a video for your business?

If you're like most marketers I know, the answer is either "too long ago" or "I paid someone way too much to do it."

Here's why I'm emailing you today:

A new tool called **InstaDoodle** just launched, and it does something I haven't seen before.

You type in what you want — a character, an object, a scene — and its DoodleAI™ engine generates a full whiteboard animation video. The kind that used to cost $500-$2,000 from agencies.

I'm talking:
- Professional doodle characters and objects generated by AI
- Scene-based timeline (drag, drop, done)
- Full animation customization
- One "Generate with AI" button that does the heavy lifting

Whiteboard videos still crush it for engagement — they outperform standard video on Facebook, YouTube, and landing pages. The problem was always *making* them.

That problem is gone now.

I've secured an exclusive bonus package worth $641 for anyone who grabs InstaDoodle through my link (more on that tomorrow).

For now, just check out what this thing can do:

Talk soon,

P.S. This is a JVZoo launch, which means the intro price won't last. I'll share the full bonus details tomorrow — but if you're the type who acts fast, the link above is live now.

## DAY 2 — Demo / Social Proof / Bonus Reveal

**Subject Line:** I made 3 doodle videos before lunch (here's the proof)

**Preview Text:** Plus: $641 in bonuses when you grab it today

**Body:**

Hey {{FIRST_NAME}},

Yesterday I told you about InstaDoodle — the AI whiteboard video creator.

Today I want to show you why I'm actually recommending this one (I skip most launches, as you know).

**Here's what sold me:**

I opened the app, typed "a friendly robot explaining email marketing," and hit the Generate button. 90 seconds later I had a whiteboard animation with custom doodle characters, smooth drawing effects, and scene transitions.

No templates to hunt through. No timeline headaches. The AI handled the creative work.

I made 3 videos in about 40 minutes — one for a landing page, one for a social ad concept, and one explainer I could hand to a client.

**What other people are saying:**

Early users are reporting they're replacing $300-$500 freelancer gigs with this tool. Agency owners are adding whiteboard videos as a new service line. Content creators are using it to stand out in crowded feeds.

**Now — here's what makes buying through my link different:**

When you grab InstaDoodle through the link below, you get my exclusive bonus stack:

🎁 **Bonus #1: Doodle Video Script Vault** (50 proven scripts across 10 niches) — Value: $297
Never stare at a blank screen. Just pick a script, paste it in, generate.

🎁 **Bonus #2: Doodle Profits Playbook** (client acquisition system for agencies) — Value: $197
Turn InstaDoodle into a client service. Includes pricing, outreach emails, and proposal templates.

🎁 **Bonus #3: YouTube & Social Distribution Toolkit** — Value: $147
Thumbnails, upload checklists, content calendar, and a repurposing guide to get views on every video you create.

**Total bonus value: $641** — yours free with InstaDoodle.

👉 **[Grab InstaDoodle + All 3 Bonuses]({{AFFILIATE_LINK}})**

After you purchase, forward your receipt to {{BONUS_EMAIL}} and I'll send your bonuses within 24 hours.

{{SENDER_NAME}}

P.S. These bonuses are designed to solve the two things InstaDoodle doesn't cover: knowing what to say in your videos, and getting people to actually watch them. The tool + these bonuses = a complete system.

## DAY 3 — Scarcity / Final Call / Deadline

**Subject Line:** InstaDoodle: final hours at this price

**Preview Text:** After tonight, the launch price is gone. So are my bonuses.

**Body:**

Hey {{FIRST_NAME}},

I'll keep this short because the clock is the message today.

**InstaDoodle's launch deal ends tonight.**

After that:
- The price goes up (this is standard for JVZoo launches — the intro pricing disappears)
- My $641 bonus package comes down (I'm only offering it during launch week)

If you've been on the fence, here's the simple math:

❌ **Without InstaDoodle:** You keep paying freelancers $300-$500 per whiteboard video. Or you keep *not* making videos and leaving engagement (and money) on the table.

✅ **With InstaDoodle:** You create unlimited whiteboard animations yourself. AI does the design work. You press a button. Cost: a one-time fee that's less than a single freelancer video.

Add my bonuses — 50 plug-and-play scripts, a client acquisition system, and a full distribution toolkit — and you're not just buying a tool. You're buying a complete video marketing operation.

This is the last email I'm sending about this.

👉 **[Get InstaDoodle Before the Price Increases]({{AFFILIATE_LINK}})**

Forward your receipt to {{BONUS_EMAIL}} for instant bonus access.

{{SENDER_NAME}}

P.S. The people who grabbed this on Day 1 are already making videos. Don't overthink it — you either want faster, cheaper whiteboard videos or you don't. If you do, the link is above. If not, no hard feelings. We'll talk about something else next week.
