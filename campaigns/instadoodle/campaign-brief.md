# Campaign Brief — InstaDoodle

**Product:** InstaDoodle — AI-Powered Doodle Video Creator
**Platform:** JVZoo
**Target Market:** Digital marketers, content creators, agency owners
**Campaign Window:** 3-day email sequence (launch week)

## Strategy Summary

InstaDoodle hits a sweet spot: whiteboard/doodle videos consistently outperform standard video content for engagement and conversions, but creating them has always required either expensive agencies ($500-2K per video) or clunky software with steep learning curves. The angle is **"AI eliminated the skill gap"** — the DoodleAI™ engine means anyone can create professional whiteboard animations in minutes, not days. The hook targets the pain of content creation fatigue: marketers who know video converts but don't have the time, budget, or design skills to produce it. We position InstaDoodle as the shortcut that turns a text prompt into a polished doodle video. Bonus stack is designed to amplify ROI by covering what the tool doesn't — scripts, distribution strategy, and client-ready templates — making our offer the obvious choice over competing affiliates. Expected EPC target: $1.20+ given the visual demo appeal and impulse-buy price point on JVZoo.
