## Bonus #1: The Doodle Video Script Vault (50 Proven Scripts)

**Description:** InstaDoodle gives you the video engine — but what do you *say* in those videos? This vault contains 50 fill-in-the-blank video scripts across 10 niches (real estate, fitness, ecommerce, coaching, SaaS, restaurants, dental, legal, financial services, digital marketing). Each script is pre-structured with a hook, problem, solution, and CTA — optimized for whiteboard-style storytelling. Just paste into InstaDoodle's scene timeline and hit generate.

**Perceived Value:** $297

**Why It Complements InstaDoodle:** The tool handles visual creation brilliantly, but most buyers will stare at a blank screen not knowing what their doodle video should actually say. This removes the #1 friction point — the script — and gets them producing finished videos in their first session.

## Bonus #2: Doodle Profits Playbook — Client Acquisition System for Agency Owners

**Description:** A step-by-step PDF + video guide showing exactly how to sell whiteboard animation videos as a service to local businesses and online brands. Includes pricing templates ($250-$500 per video), a cold outreach email sequence (5 emails), a sample proposal template, and a Fiverr/Upwork gig optimization guide. Built specifically for people using InstaDoodle as their production tool.

**Perceived Value:** $197

**Why It Complements InstaDoodle:** A huge segment of InstaDoodle buyers are agency owners and freelancers who want to resell videos. InstaDoodle is the creation tool — this bonus is the business model. It turns a software purchase into an income stream, which dramatically increases buyer satisfaction and reduces refund rates.

## Bonus #3: YouTube & Social Distribution Toolkit — Templates, Thumbnails & Upload Checklists

**Description:** A done-for-you distribution kit containing 20 Canva thumbnail templates designed for doodle-style videos, platform-specific upload checklists for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Reels, Facebook, and LinkedIn (with optimal settings, hashtags, and posting times), plus a 30-day content calendar template. Also includes a guide to repurposing one doodle video into 5 pieces of content across platforms.

**Perceived Value:** $147

**Why It Complements InstaDoodle:** Creating the video is only half the battle — getting eyeballs on it is the other half. InstaDoodle has zero distribution features. This bonus ensures buyers actually get results from the videos they create, which means they stay excited about the tool (and don't refund).
